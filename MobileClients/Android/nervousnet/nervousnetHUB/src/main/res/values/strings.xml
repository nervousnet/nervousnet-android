		This
		Software application
		("App") serves to jointly produce real-time data
		about our world to
		create new opportunities for everyone. In
		particular, you may run other
		apps on top of the Nervousnet platform,
		including gaming
		applications!&lt;br>&lt;br>

		Nervousnet measures data as
		you provide it
		by opening up virtual or real sensors
		in your smartphone,
		other smart
		devices, or external sensors you have
		chosen to add to this
		Internet-of-Things kind of system.&lt;br>&lt;br>

		The control panel of
		the Nervousnet 1.0 Beta App offers two privacy
		control levels for each
		sensor: you can decide to store information on
		your own device only, or
		share it with others. If you choose the
		latter, the data are shared in
		an anonymized way. We make efforts to
		overlay filters to measurement
		sensors that we feel would otherwise be
		too privacy-intrusive (such as
		the microphone) and to be transparent
		about our code and what it does,
		and about the measurements, too. For
		this reason, the backend of
		Nervousnet 1.0 Beta is open source under
		the GPLv3
		licence.&lt;br>&lt;br>

		The data measured by this App may provide
		information about your
		environment and/or activities, and it may be
		further processed for
		personal, scientific, not-for-profit or
		commercial use. If you choose
		to share your measurement data, you
		consent to such processing and
		uses. This policy serves to enable an
		information-, innovation- and
		application-ecosystem that can unleash
		the power of information for
		you and everyone.&lt;br>&lt;br>

		By using
		Nervousnet and/or the data produced by it, you agree and ensure
		to use
		it only in lawful ways. In case of violations of laws, you take
		full
		legal responsibility for any consequences and you may be excluded
		from
		using Nervousnet and the data produced by it.&lt;br>&lt;br>

		This
		Software ("App") and related data are provided "as is", without
		warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to
		the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose
		and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright
		holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether
		in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or
		in connection with the Software or the use or other dealings in the
		Software, including the gathering, production, storage, processing,
		and use of data, or any loss of data.&lt;br>&lt;br>


		&lt;b>FURTHER
		NOTES&lt;/b>&lt;br>&lt;br>

		The Nervousnet community aims to:&lt;br>
		-
		create participatory opportunities&lt;br>
		- support informational
		self-control&lt;br>
		- increase distributed design and control
		elements&lt;br>
		- add transparency for the sake of trust&lt;br>
		- reduce
		information biases and noise&lt;br>
		- enable user-controlled
		information filters&lt;br>
		- support socio-economic diversity&lt;br>
		-
		increase interoperability and innovation&lt;br>
		- build coordination
		tools&lt;br>
		- create digital assistants&lt;br>
		- support
		collective/\"swarm\" intelligence&lt;br>
		- measure and consider
		externalities&lt;br>
		- enable favorable feedback loops&lt;br>
		- support
		fair value exchange&lt;br>
		- increase digital literacy and
		awareness&lt;br>&lt;br>

		&lt;p>Accordingly, in future we are planning to
		extend the functionality of the App and user control of the data you
		have decided to share. It will take time though to provide all
		functionality we have in mind and to continuously increase security
		standards. This will be gradually done, as announced on the
		Nervousnet-related forums and websites &lt;a
		href=\'http://nervousnet.ethz.ch\'>http://nervousnet.ethz.ch&lt;/a>,
		and we would like to cordially invite you to contribute to the
		development of this system, which we envisage to a system by for
		citizens, similar to Wikipedia or OpenStreetMap. So, please test
		Nervousnet 1.0 beta, give us feedback &lt;a
		href=\'mailto:nervousnet@ethz.ch\'>nervousnet@ethz.ch&lt;/a>, and
		help!&lt;/br></string>
